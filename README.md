# Smedja
Smedja is a work-in-progress game engine I'm developing while following along with The Cherno's Game Engine series.

Prounounced smee-ah-dee-ah, Smedja means "forge" or "smithery" in Swedish.

## TODO
Instead of forking all dependencies, maybe modify build process to avoid adding premake and updating `.gitignore` files in all dep repos.
