# Smedja
Smedja is a game engine based on [TheCherno's Hazel game engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

Prounounced smee-ah-dee-ah, Smedja means "forge" or "smithery" in Swedish.

## TODO
Instead of forking all dependencies, maybe modify build process to avoid adding premake and updating `.gitignore` files in all dep repos.
